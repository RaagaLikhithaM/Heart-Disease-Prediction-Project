# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning-based approach to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical features. The objective is to assist in early diagnosis and potentially improve clinical outcomes through data-driven insights.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset used (`heart.csv`) includes 14 attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate achieved, and more. It is a cleaned and preprocessed version suitable for model training.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Hyperparameter tuning and model comparison
- Final model selection based on performance

## 📊 Results
The best-performing model achieved high predictive accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of using ML for heart disease prediction.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook `Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`

## 📁 Files
- `heart.csv`: Cleaned dataset
- `Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Full code with analysis and model building

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Integrate SHAP for model interpretability
- Deploy model with a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
